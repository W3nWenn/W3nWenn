Hiya everyone, welcome on our GitHub page!
We are a system and we usually go by our systems hosts name (Wen), unless you know what alter you're speaking to, then please use their name.
You can also call us Shell System or Shells when referring to all of us.
(please try to avoid using "Shell" for us.)

People coming from PonyTown, please read our pronouns.cc: https://pronouns.cc/@WenW3n
Almost all of our alters have their own PonyTown character and will use them when fronting. You'll be able to recognize it's an alter's character by our 'flair' that's behind the alter's name "name ||Shell System"
